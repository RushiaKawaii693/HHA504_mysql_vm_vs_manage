# Comparison
For a small student project, a maintained database is an excellent option.  Automatic backups, minimal need for sophisticated configuration tuning, and a low cost are all critical for student projects requiring an efficient database.  Furthermore, a modest student project does not require large workloads, which a managed database can readily handle. 

 A self-managed MySQL VM is appropriate for a departmental analytics database.  The flexibility in adding users, credentials, rights, and configuring the database improves efficiency.  However, if cost or automatic backup/scaling are an issue, a Managed database may be a good solution because it provides low cost over time, automated backups, performance options, and analysis tools for database performance using logs.

For HIPAA-compliant workloads, a managed database is recommended. The managed options offer improved security, automated backups, the ability to handle massive workloads, encryption options, and additional configuration options. It also transfers the strain away from the users by handling the majority of software issues and scalability.
